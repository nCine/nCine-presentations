## C++ Engine Programming with nCine
image::banner.png[role="plain"]
Part 4: Overview of the Rendering System

https://ncine.github.io

## Features

* Uses OpenGL 3.3 and OpenGL ES 3.0
* Can use http://angleproject.org/[ANGLE] on Windows
* Supports https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Vertex_Array_Object[VAO], https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Texture_Storage#Immutable_storage[immutable textures], BO https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Buffer_Object#Mapping[mapping], indexing
* Automatic batching and culling of sprites to achieve higher performances
* Texture loader supporting many GPU compressed formats
* https://renderdoc.org/docs/in_application_api.html[In-application] integration with https://renderdoc.org/[RenderDoc]

## The Code

* All code related to rendering is in https://github.com/nCine/nCine/tree/develop/src/graphics[`src/graphics`]
** https://github.com/nCine/nCine/tree/develop/src/graphics/RenderCommand.cpp[`RenderCommand`], https://github.com/nCine/nCine/tree/develop/src/graphics/RenderQueue.cpp[`RenderQueue`], https://github.com/nCine/nCine/tree/develop/src/graphics/RenderBatcher.cpp[`RenderBatcher`], https://github.com/nCine/nCine/tree/develop/src/graphics/RenderResources.cpp[`RenderResources`], https://github.com/nCine/nCine/tree/develop/src/graphics/RenderBuffersManager.cpp[`RenderBuffersManager`], https://github.com/nCine/nCine/tree/develop/src/graphics/RenderVaoPool.cpp[`RenderVaoPool`], https://github.com/nCine/nCine/tree/develop/src/graphics/RenderStatistics.cpp[`RenderStatistics`]
* OpenGL wrap classes in https://github.com/nCine/nCine/tree/develop/src/graphics/opengl[`src/graphics/opengl`]
** Low-level code dealing with shaders, textures, BOs, FBOs, VAOs, vertex formats, etc.

* BO is an OpenGL buffer object

## RenderCommand Class

image::RenderCommand.png[role="plain"]

* Carries all the information to issue a draw call
* `Material` contains shader related information
* `Geometry` contains vertex and index data

## RenderQueue Class

image::RenderQueue.png[role="plain"]

* Collects render commands into queues
* Sorts opaques FtoB and transparents BtoF
* Batches commands together if batching is enabled
* Flushes the `RenderBuffersManager`
* Issue the commands

[.notes]
--
* FtoB is front-to-back, to minimize overdraw
* BtoF is back-to-front, for correct alpha blending
--

## RenderBatcher Class

* Uniform, vertex, and index BO data is merged
* Degenerate vertices or indices are created
* Index values are rewritten
* Uses a pool of render commands just for batching
* Already sorted input queue makes it easier to identify split points

## RenderResources Class

* Creates and makes available common resources
** Creates shader programs and the VAO pool
** Owns the `RenderBuffersManager` singleton and the projection matrix
* Has a minimal creation mode for non scenegraph based rendering

## RenderBuffersManager Class

* Handles memory for uniform, vertex, and index BOs
* Assigns buffer chunks to objects requesting memory
* Creates more buffers if more memory is required
* Unmaps or uploads buffers at the end

## RenderVaoPool Class

* Created at start by the `RenderResources` class
* Binds a Vertex Array Object based on a vertex format

## RenderStatistics Class

* Gathers statistics about the frame being rendered
** Number of vertices, render commands, instances
** How many commands are batched
** How many commands are transparents vs opaque
** Divides results per type (sprite, particle, gui, etc.)
